# Luminesce Labs

Research laboratory developing formal frameworks for AI safety assurance, security architectures, and cognitive systems with mathematical foundations for industrial deployment.

## Published Frameworks

All frameworks published on Zenodo with DOI registration for citation and reproducibility.

### 🧠 [The Cognitive Quad (C4) Framework](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17507501)
Computational model of human cognition across four operational modes (Analytical, Intuitive, Reflective, Associative). Provides formal compositional properties for understanding cognitive processing and decision-making.

**Status**: Published specification | Active development on implementation tooling

---

### 🔒 [ASIL-M: AI Safety Integrity Level](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17574019)
Multi-root trust architecture providing mathematically independent assurance paths for AI systems in safety-critical applications. Addresses single-point-of-failure risks in conventional safety frameworks through coprime factorization.

**Applications**: Autonomous systems, industrial automation, healthcare AI  
**Status**: Published specification | Formal verification tooling in development

---

### 📊 [EBDP+EFI: Entropy-Bounded Data Pipelines](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17591298)
Framework for quantitative AI assurance through thermodynamic constraints. Entropy-Bounded Data Pipelines establish information-theoretic guarantees while Entropy-Frugal Intelligence provides resource efficiency metrics for industrial AI systems.

**Key Innovation**: Compositional entropy budgets enabling formal reasoning about AI system behavior  
**Status**: Published framework | Industrial case studies in progress

---

### 🛡️ [Coprime-Factor Security Architecture](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17513366)
Formal approach eliminating correlation risks in security systems through mathematical independence constraints. Uses coprime factorization to ensure security components cannot share vulnerabilities through common factors.

**Applications**: Multi-layer defense, cryptographic systems, supply chain security  
**Status**: Published specification | Integration patterns under development
