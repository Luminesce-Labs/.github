## Active Development & TRL-6 Verification

### 🛡️ [AxoDen Safety Kernel (Semantic Firewall)](https://github.com/Luminesce-Labs/axoden-forensic-ledger)
**Status:** TRL-6 (System Demonstration) | **Architecture:** Reference Implementation

The AxoDen Safety Kernel is a **deterministic enforcement layer** for autonomous AI agents. Unlike probabilistic guardrails, it applies a thermodynamic limit to data streams using principles from information physics (entropy-bounded data pipelines), providing a hard, non-heuristic safety boundary.

It has been system-verified against two critical threat classes:

* **Agentic Hallucination:** Deterministic blocking of fabrication ("Twin-Liar" paradoxes) by detecting **surplus entropy > 3.5 bits**, preventing model collapse in critical decision loops.
* **Zero-Day Ransomware:** Instant neutralization of unauthorized encryption by detecting its **thermodynamic signature** (Vacuum State), independent of conventional signatures.

> *Includes: Immutable Ledger Logs, Entropy Metric Dumps, and Executive Narratives.*

## Published Frameworks

The following frameworks are published on Zenodo (Restricted) with DOI registration for academic and industrial citation.

### 🧠 [The Cognitive Quad (C4) Framework](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17507501)
Computational model of human cognition across four operational modes (Analytical, Intuitive, Reflective, Associative). Provides formal compositional properties for understanding cognitive processing and decision-making.
**Status:** Published specification | Active development on implementation tooling

### 🔒 [ASIL-M: AI Safety Integrity Level](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17574019)
Multi-root trust architecture providing mathematically independent assurance paths for AI systems in safety-critical applications. Addresses single-point-of-failure risks in conventional safety frameworks through coprime factorization.
**Status:** Published specification | Formal verification tooling in development

### 📊 [EBDP+EFI: Entropy-Bounded Data Pipelines](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17591298)
Framework for quantitative AI assurance through thermodynamic constraints. Establishes information-theoretic guarantees while providing resource efficiency metrics for industrial AI systems.
**Status:** Published framework | Industrial case studies in progress

### 🛡️ [Coprime-Factor Security Architecture](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17513366)
Formal approach eliminating correlation risks in security systems through mathematical independence constraints. Uses coprime factorization to ensure security components cannot share vulnerabilities through common factors.
**Status:** Published specification | Integration patterns under development
