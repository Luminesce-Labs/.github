# Luminesce Labs

**Transparency starts where opacity ends.**

Luminesce Labs is a research programme by Luminesce Limited (UK) focused on deterministic AI assurance and security.
The work develops safety-oriented architectures, inline security middleware, and agentic cyber-defence systems grounded in information theory, formal methods, and physical constraints, designed for industrial and regulated deployment.

## Why Luminesce Labs Exists

Modern AI and autonomous systems fail not only due to capability gaps, but because they lack **enforceable operational boundaries**.  
Luminesce Labs develops **information-theoretic and formal safety frameworks** that transform AI safety from policy and heuristics into **measurable, enforceable system constraints** suitable for regulated and high-consequence environments (including defence and critical infrastructure).

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Deployable middleware:** AxoDen Safety Kernel / **Semantic Firewall Architecture (SFA)** for inline, pre-triage enforcement in security pipelines.
- **Applied platform:** **Agentic SOC automation** (A2A-coordinated) for threat detection, triage, reporting, and controlled threat hunting.
- **Published specifications:** Zenodo DOIs for AxoDen components (some restricted due to dual-use sensitivity and ongoing patent activity).

### What this repository is not
- Not a model benchmark project.
- Not a “prompting” toolkit.
- Not a claim of perfect detection. The focus is **control, auditability, bounded operation, and safe degradation**.

## Deployment-Ready Components (Scenario-Qualified)

### AxoDen Safety Kernel (Semantic Firewall Architecture — SFA)

**Status: Deployment-ready safety middleware**

The AxoDen Safety Kernel is a production-grade middleware layer that enforces **calibrated information-quality constraints** at runtime. It is designed to operate **inside the execution/decision path** (inline, pre-triage), applying deterministic admission, downgrade, isolation, or halt semantics when verifiability limits are exceeded.

This is not post-hoc filtering. The kernel is intended to prevent unsafe propagation into downstream triage and reporting.

#### Scenario-driven qualification focus

**1) Hallucination-risk suppression (EFI)**  
Evidence-bounded gating that suppresses fabrication risk by enforcing calibrated surplus/grounding predicates and fail-closed behaviour in closed decision loops.

**2) Ransomware-style execution threats (EBDP / execution-path control)**  
Pre-triage containment by detecting high-entropy irreversible transformations consistent with mass encryption and semantic loss, then enforcing deterministic interruption within calibrated latency bounds.

**3) Correlated failure / monoculture risk (CFS / IS–CMRI)**  
Independence engineering across roots (models/agents/vendors/pipelines), measuring common-mode risk and gating ensembles when correlation exceeds thresholds.

#### Operational artefacts
- Real-time entropy / quality monitoring
- Append-only event and evidence records (provenance-first logging)
- Scenario qualification reports (where disclosure is permissible)

## Agentic SOC Automation Platform (A2A Coordinated)

An applied cybersecurity system implementing AxoDen patterns for AI-assisted operations:

- **Threat detection and triage** with evidence-led, audit-ready outputs
- **A2A orchestration** separating ingestion, corroboration, summarisation, and reporting roles
- **Controlled report generation** with provenance tagging and deterministic logging
- Interoperability-oriented outputs (structured exports where applicable)

### Investigative Mode (Hypotheses-enabled threat hunting)

A constrained mode that supports hypothesis-driven hunting (e.g., unseen infrastructure, plausible next-stage actions) while enforcing containment rules so **unsupported hypotheses cannot enter operational decision paths**. This allows exploratory reasoning without contaminating operational decisions.

---

## How This Differs from Conventional AI Safety

- Enforcement is **inline** (pre-triage), not post-hoc filtering.
- Outputs are **evidence-led** and **audit-friendly** (provenance and traceability).
- Unsafe regimes trigger deterministic actions: **reject / downgrade / isolate / verify**.
- Designed for certification-oriented environments and controlled deployment.

## Research Approach

The work prioritises:
- **Mathematical rigour:** formal definitions, compositional properties, and explicit constraints.
- **Industrial applicability:** designed for real-world operating conditions and audit expectations.
- **Quantitative assurance:** measurable properties (entropy, independence, correlation risk).
- **Sovereign capability:** designed to remain robust when external update channels or intelligence feeds are unavailable or compromised.
