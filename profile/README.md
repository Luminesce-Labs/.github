## Active Deployment & TRL-8 Verification

🛡️ AxoDen Safety Kernel (Semantic Firewall)

**Status: TRL-8 (Flight Qualified)** | Environment: Operational | Limit: 5.2831 bits (Calibrated)

The AxoDen Safety Kernel is a production-grade Semantic Firewall for autonomous agent networks. It has graduated from a reference implementation to active middleware, enforcing a hard thermodynamic limit on all data streams. By treating information as a physical quantity, it provides deterministic protection where probabilistic guardrails fail.

The system is currently Flight Qualified against three critical failure modes:

**1. Agentic Hallucination (EFI)**: Deterministic rejection of ontological fabrication ("Twin-Liar" paradoxes). The kernel enforces a calibrated Entropy Surplus limit of 0.8 bits, preventing model collapse in decision loops.

**2. Zero-Day Ransomware (EBDP)**: Instant neutralization of unauthorized encryption. The middleware detects the Thermodynamic Vacuum state (Entropy > 5.2831 bits) and severs the connection in <1.5ms, independent of signature databases.

**3. Structural Monoculture (CFS)**: Prevention of correlated cascade failures. The Cross-Model Risk Index (CMRI) actively gates agent squads, enforcing geometric independence (1−IS+ϵ) to ensure resilience.

View Live Telemetry & Flight Deck Includes: Real-time Entropy Gauge, Semantic 5-Tuple Ledger, and TRL-8 Calibration Reports.
