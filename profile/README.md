## Published Frameworks

Below frameworks published on Zenodo (Restricted) with DOI registration.

### 🧠 [The Cognitive Quad (C4) Framework](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17507501)
Computational model of human cognition across four operational modes (Analytical, Intuitive, Reflective, Associative). Provides formal compositional properties for understanding cognitive processing and decision-making.

**Status**: Published specification | Active development on implementation tooling

---

### 🔒 [ASIL-M: AI Safety Integrity Level](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17574019)
Multi-root trust architecture providing mathematically independent assurance paths for AI systems in safety-critical applications. Addresses single-point-of-failure risks in conventional safety frameworks through coprime factorization.

**Applications**: Autonomous systems, industrial automation, healthcare AI  
**Status**: Published specification | Formal verification tooling in development

---

### 📊 [EBDP+EFI: Entropy-Bounded Data Pipelines](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17591298)
Framework for quantitative AI assurance through thermodynamic constraints. Entropy-Bounded Data Pipelines establish information-theoretic guarantees while Entropy-Frugal Intelligence provides resource efficiency metrics for industrial AI systems.

**Key Innovation**: Compositional entropy budgets enabling formal reasoning about AI system behavior  
**Status**: Published framework | Industrial case studies in progress

---

### 🛡️ [Coprime-Factor Security Architecture](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17513366)
Formal approach eliminating correlation risks in security systems through mathematical independence constraints. Uses coprime factorization to ensure security components cannot share vulnerabilities through common factors.

**Applications**: Multi-layer defense, cryptographic systems, supply chain security  
**Status**: Published specification | Integration patterns under development

## Active Development

### AxoDen Semantic Firewall / Entropic Firewall: Reference Architecture based on 



AxoDen Math Repository**: Private during patent process | Documentation forthcoming

The AxoDen Safety Kernel is a deterministic enforcement layer for autonomous AI agents. Unlike probabilistic guardrails, it applies a thermodynamic limit to data streams using principles from information physics (entropy-bounded data pipelines), providing a hard, non-heuristic safety boundary. It has been system-verified against two critical threat classes:
	• **Agentic hallucination**: Deterministic blocking of fabrication (“Twin-Liar” paradoxes) by detecting surplus entropy > 3.5 bits, preventing model collapse in critical decision loops.
	•	**Zero-day ransomware**: Instant neutralisation of unauthorised encryption by detecting its thermodynamic signature (Vacuum State), independent of conventional signatures.
