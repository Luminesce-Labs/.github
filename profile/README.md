## Active Development & TRL-6 Verification

### 🛡️ [AxoDen Safety Kernel (Semantic Firewall)](https://github.com/Luminesce-Labs/axoden-forensic-ledger)
**Status:** TRL-6 (System Demonstration) | **Architecture:** Reference Implementation

The AxoDen Safety Kernel is a **deterministic enforcement layer** for autonomous AI agents. Unlike probabilistic guardrails, it applies a thermodynamic limit to data streams using principles from information physics (entropy-bounded data pipelines), providing a hard, non-heuristic safety boundary.

It has been system-verified against two critical threat classes:

* **Agentic Hallucination:** Deterministic blocking of fabrication ("Twin-Liar" paradoxes) by detecting **surplus entropy > 3.5 bits**, preventing model collapse in critical decision loops.
* **Zero-Day Ransomware:** Instant neutralization of unauthorized encryption by detecting its **thermodynamic signature** (Vacuum State), independent of conventional signatures.

## Research Approach

Our frameworks prioritize:
- **Mathematical Rigor:** Formal proofs and compositional guarantees.
- **Industrial Applicability:** Designed for real-world constraints ("Secure by Design").
- **Quantitative Assurance:** Measurable safety properties (Entropy, Independence).
- **Sovereign Capability:** Aligned with UK national security and critical infrastructure standards.
